# 🌌 Interactive ML Portfolio Website – Sri Akash Kadali

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a visual, interactive experience built to represent my journey as an **aspiring Machine Learning Engineer**.

Although I’m not a front-end developer by profession, I built this portfolio using modern web technologies like **React.js** and **Three.js** to creatively showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in **Machine Learning, AI, and Computer Vision**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

As a Machine Learning Engineer in training, I wanted a portfolio that:
- Represents my personality and technical background visually
- Demonstrates initiative and creativity outside the ML domain
- Serves as a gateway for recruiters, collaborators, and peers

This website is a reflection of my passion for blending creativity with technical skills.
