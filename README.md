# 🌌 Sri Akash Kadali – Interactive Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to **[srikadali.com](https://srikadali.com)** — a dynamic and immersive portfolio designed to reflect my journey as an **aspiring Machine Learning Engineer** with a passion for creativity and impactful technology.

While I don’t come from a front-end development background, I independently built this website to bridge the gap between technical depth and creative expression, using modern technologies like **React.js**, **Three.js**, and **Framer Motion**.

## 🎯 Mission

This portfolio is more than just a website — it’s a showcase of initiative and creativity outside the conventional ML space. My goals were to:

- Visually narrate my journey and technical growth in ML and AI  
- Design an experience that resonates with recruiters and collaborators  
- Demonstrate my commitment to real-world application and creativity
